# Pig game!
A simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

### Rules: 
- The game has 2 players.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they whish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game!
